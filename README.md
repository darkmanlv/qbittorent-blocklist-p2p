# Best-blocklist
Looking for a nice and complete blocklist for torrent sonftware can be a pain, especially if you’re not sure of which one to pick. In fact there are a ton of lists all for different purposes and no one will give you complete bad-peer protection since one will shield your client from spammers, one from the US Government [really?] and no one from all those things combined.

Here my safe list, Only ban bad peer and some copyright ips, other blacklist ban many good ips for seedbox.
